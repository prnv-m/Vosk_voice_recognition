# Audio Capture & Recognition Interface
This project is a real-time audio capture and recognition system integrating Vosk (for speech recognition) and PortAudio (for low-latency audio input/output). The goal is to build a complete audio processing pipeline, and current development efforts are focused on adding a WebRTC interface to enable real-time audio streaming over the web.
This will further be used in a project involving video interfaces.

## Features
âœ… Live audio capture using PortAudio

âœ… Offline speech recognition powered by Vosk

ðŸ”„ WebRTC integration (in progress) to enable remote access and real-time interaction

# Setup
Run make file to install all dependencies using:
```
make install-deps
make
./cppaudiocap
```

# Install a suitable vox model based on language and hardware constraints
